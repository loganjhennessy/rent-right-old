# Factors to limit scope

## Type

There are different types of properties that get listed.

  - Homes
  - Apartments
  - Vacation rentals (i.e. AirBnB)
  - Long-term rentals

I could pick subset of these to investigate.

## Location

Of course, the most obvious is to start with Seattle.

  - Seattle
  - Specific neighborhood(s)

It could be scoped down to a specific neighborhood, or scoped up to
the greater Seattle area or out from there.

## Source

### Primary

There are so many different sites out there for posting properties.
  - Craigslist
  - Oodle
    - It looks like they have an amazing API, but you can't currently request
      a key. https://www.oodle.com/info/developer/request-api-key/
    - Check back later.
  - Zillow
  - Hotpads
  - Trulia
  - Doorstep
  - Walk Score
  - Rentals.com
  - Rent.com
  - Cribspot
    - Co-founded by a friend, so potentially access to a non-public dataset.

### Ideas for Supplementary Features

- Pull the Walk Score from walkscore.com
- Proximity to a bus stop, also from walkscore.com
- The median rental price from Zillow
