Rent Right
==========

**What's in a listing?**

A price estimator for residential rental listings trained on ~25k listings in
the Seattle rental market.

# Motivation

Through my own experience as a renter, I have developed somewhat of a 6th sense
for the value of a property given the contents of it's advertisement. Things
like image quality and text write-up can indicate weather a property is over or
under-priced. At present, this assessment is completely subjective and done in
my head. This project is an attempt to codify that assessment.

# Current Status
