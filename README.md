# Rent Right

What hidden features make a rental listing over or under the expected value?

# Motivation

Through my own experience as a renter, I have found that I have developed
somewhat of a 6th sense for the value of a property given the contents of it's
advertisement. Things like image quality, text write-up, location, and various
other features can indicate weather a property is over or under-priced. At
present, this assessment is completely subjective and done in my head. This
project is an attempt to codify that assessment.
