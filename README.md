# Rent Scraper

Scrapes rental apartment and housing data with Python and stores in
MongoDB.

This project was established to provide data for the [Rent Right](https://github.com/loganjhennessy/rent-right) project. Please
follow the link for more details.

# Motivation

The need for a scraper that was separate from the Rent Right application
was evident early on in the project's development. Thus was born a
general purpose scraper for apartment data.

Scalability is the primary reason for this separation of concerns. If
the Rent Right application is ever to be expanded to different cities,
neighborhoods, or even data sources, the underlying web scraper must be
flexible enough to accommodate such changes with minimal re-factoring.
